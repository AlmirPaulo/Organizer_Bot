# Organizer_Bot
A bot that works on the background moving all the files from the Downloads directory to the right directories based on the file type.

## Installation

## Possible Issues
### Does it works on Windows?
Not yet. 
### Its not working with some kinds of files.
The bot recognizes a specific list of file extensions. I made it in a way that only works with open formats. Just to be sure that its all legal. I also focused in the most used of this formats. If you miss any file format, please let me know. So here is a list of file extensions the bot should recognize.

## Thanks
Thanks to [Kalle Hallden](https://github.com/KalleHallden) for the inspiration to make this bot. He made a similar one in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbW6FRbaSl0&t=246s&ab_channel=KalleHallden) and I thought it was a great idea, but maybe a could code it in other way, I mean, with less resources.
